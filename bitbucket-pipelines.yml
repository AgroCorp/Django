#  Template to deploy a Python Django application

#  This template allows you to deploy your Python Django application to the Google App Engine.
#  The workflow allows running tests, code linting and security scans on feature branches (as well as master).
#  The Python Django application will be deployed after the code is merged to master.

# Prerequisites: $KEY_FILE and $PROJECT setup in the Deployment variables.
# For advanced cases, please, follow examples from the pipe's README https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/google-app-engine-deploy/src/master/README.md
# Your environment variables should also be declared in the app.yaml.template.
